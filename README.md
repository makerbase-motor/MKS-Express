# MKS-Express
MKS Express is a product designed based on VESC Express, featuring functional modules for data logging, GPS connectivity, and wireless communication (WiFi/Bluetooth).

MKS Express enables wireless debugging, firmware updates, data analysis, and log file access for your VESC motherboard via WiFi or Bluetooth through VESC Tool. Both WiFi and Bluetooth can be configured with personalized names and PIN codes for secure data transmission. The device can operate as a password-protected WiFi access point (AP mode) or connect to an existing WiFi network (station mode).
